# Furniture Store Single Page Application (SPA)

## Overview

The Furniture Store is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and several modern libraries. The application allows users to perform various actions including login, registration, managing furniture items (create, edit, delete), and viewing details of both their own and other users' furniture.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **lit-html** for templating
- **page.js** for routing
- **mocha** and **chai** for testing
- **playwright** for browser automation

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Furniture Store application:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `Furniture` directory where the client-side code is located.

```bash
cd Furniture
```

Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install lit-html page
```

If you want to run tests, also install the testing libraries:

```bash

```

For browser automation testing with Playwright, install it with:

```bash
npm install --save-dev playwright-chromium
```

### 2. Start the Server

Navigate to the `server` directory where the server-side code is located.

```bash
cd server
