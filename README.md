# Furniture Store Single Page Application (SPA)

## Overview

The Furniture Store is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and several modern libraries. The application allows users to perform various actions including login, registration, managing furniture items (create, edit, delete, search), and viewing details of both their own and other users' furniture. Authentication is implemented using local storage to store user credentials securely.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **lit-html** for templating
- **page.js** for routing

## Getting Started

### To save you Time
Run the file called `run.bat`. For first-time users, it will install the necessary node packages. On subsequent runs, it will start the server and open the website. **Highly recommended.**

Follow the steps below to set up and run the Furniture Store application:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the Terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npm i
```

### 2. Start the Server

Navigate to the `server` directory where the server-side code is located.

```bash
cd server
```

Start the server using Node.js:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will now be running, and you can interact with the application.

### 3. To start the Website

You can either run a new Terminal with the command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Or you can use an extension of your choice.
